# J-ZX81
The original Java ZX81 emulator!

I wrote this during the 98/99 academic year for my final year university project 22 years ago :-)

Now available again with source code, and patched to compile and run with the latest version
of Java (SE 15).  I had to make a few classes public as calling methods in non public classes via
a public reference is no longer allowed, but surprisingly no other code changes were required.

NB switching the emulation speed to "Full" no longer works properly, but everything is still
   fine at normal speed.  My PC is obviously now a lot faster than the original dev machine!!!
   I will investigate this and fix at some point.

To run simply download and run the jar file:
